# TerrariaOGC USAGE & SOURCE LICENSE

The source for TerrariaOGC features code from a decompilation of Terraria's 'Old-Gen' console versions (in particular, these are the iterations released on the Xbox 360 & PlayStation 3), first released in 2013.

Modifications have been made in order to get the initial decompilation ported effectively on a modern Windows system, but there is the option for it to run on official XDK hardware.

All source code featured is provided without liability or warranty for the end-user and any endorsed derivative uses. The related authors of the official versions of Terraria and the author of TerrariaOGC, as well as any related endorsed party to the aforementioned, are also not held liable and/or responsible for any claim, damages or other liability stated.

- TerrariaOGC is not and never will be used for commercial use.
- This license is to be featured and adhered to, in any fork of the source code.

  - No code will be published to this repository if it causes Trial Mode to be off by default or features a method to bypass the need for user-provided assets.
